# Templeta

Templeta is a template engine for .Net which can parse text templates.

## Why

We do this as there are no good looking easy to use template engines out there for general purpose text parsing.

## How

We will implement this from scratch without using any third party library for parsing.
We will develop the project test driven from geginning to ensure the quality of the project.

## Goal

Our goal on this is to create a free, fast, light weight and general purpose template engine for all versions of .Net
